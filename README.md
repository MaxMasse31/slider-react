## Branch Structure Explanation

In this repository, we maintain two branches, `main` and `logic-code-v1`, as well as `logic-code-v2`. Here's an explanation of what each branch contains:

### Main Branch

The `main` branch primarily contains the core codebase of the project without specific logic implementations. It serves as a base version of the project without any specific feature or logic related to our application.

### logic-code-v1 Branch

The `logic-code-v1` branch represents my initial approach to implementing a specific logic feature in the project. This branch contains my custom logic solution that I developed independently.

### logic-code-v2 Branch

The `logic-code-v2` branch, on the other hand, represents an alternative solution for the same logic feature, which is based on the approach taught in an Udemy course. It provides a different implementation for the same feature, showcasing an alternative method learned from the course.

This branching strategy allows for easy comparison and experimentation with different logic implementations while keeping the base project clean in the `main` branch.
